# Compliance Log

[2026-07-17 00:00] Phase 0 Compliance Check
  Changed: (none yet — pre-implementation check)
  Vision Docs Checked: `Project Vision/01_PRODUCT_VISION_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  Sections Checked:
    - §3 Functional Architecture (workspace/wiki/pages, `init`/`ingest` command signatures)
    - §4.1 Layered Architecture (Layer 1 = deterministic PDF extraction, $0 LLM)
    - §4.2 Incremental Ingestion (SHA-256 tracking of PDFs)
    - §4.4 Chunking Strategy (never split a page)
    - §5 Who Decides What (text extraction, hashing, file I/O = deterministic code: pdfjs-dist, fs, crypto)
    - §7 Non-Goals (no web interface)
  Comparison:
    - CLI `init <slug> --title -w <workspace>` and `ingest <slug>` signatures match §3 workflow exactly. COMPLIANT.
    - `extractText` (pdfjs-dist) and "never splits a page" match §4.4 and §5. COMPLIANT.
    - `sha256` (crypto) supports §4.2 hash-tracked incremental ingestion. COMPLIANT.
    - TUI (Ink, terminal UI) does not violate §7 "no web interface" — it is not a web UI; the tool remains a CLI. COMPLIANT.
    - `callLLM` wrapper is infrastructure for Layer 2 (§4.1). COMPLIANT.
    - Golden master PDF fixture is test infrastructure not mentioned in vision — EXTENSION, no conflict.
    - Phase 0 builds no init/ingest/agent logic, consistent with the layered plan. COMPLIANT.
  Result: COMPLIANT (with one noted EXTENSION: test fixtures)
  Checked By: Main agent (phase orchestrator)
  Notes / risks (not contradictions, flagged for Implementer):
    1. Gate 0.3 shells out to `shasum -a 256` — platform is Windows/Git Bash; if `shasum` is not executable from the test runner's shell, the Implementer may adapt the comparison method and must document the deviation in the status file.
    2. Gate 0.4 requires a live LLM call, but no API key env vars are set and the phase LLM budget is $0. Awaiting user decision on provider/key before that gate can pass.
