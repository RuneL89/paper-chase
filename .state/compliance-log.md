# Compliance Log

[2026-07-17 00:00] Phase 0 Compliance Check
  Changed: (none yet — pre-implementation check)
  Vision Docs Checked: `Project Vision/01_PRODUCT_VISION_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  Sections Checked:
    - §3 Functional Architecture (workspace/wiki/pages, `init`/`ingest` command signatures)
    - §4.1 Layered Architecture (Layer 1 = deterministic PDF extraction, $0 LLM)
    - §4.2 Incremental Ingestion (SHA-256 tracking of PDFs)
    - §4.4 Chunking Strategy (never split a page)
    - §5 Who Decides What (text extraction, hashing, file I/O = deterministic code: pdfjs-dist, fs, crypto)
    - §7 Non-Goals (no web interface)
  Comparison:
    - CLI `init <slug> --title -w <workspace>` and `ingest <slug>` signatures match §3 workflow exactly. COMPLIANT.
    - `extractText` (pdfjs-dist) and "never splits a page" match §4.4 and §5. COMPLIANT.
    - `sha256` (crypto) supports §4.2 hash-tracked incremental ingestion. COMPLIANT.
    - TUI (Ink, terminal UI) does not violate §7 "no web interface" — it is not a web UI; the tool remains a CLI. COMPLIANT.
    - `callLLM` wrapper is infrastructure for Layer 2 (§4.1). COMPLIANT.
    - Golden master PDF fixture is test infrastructure not mentioned in vision — EXTENSION, no conflict.
    - Phase 0 builds no init/ingest/agent logic, consistent with the layered plan. COMPLIANT.
  Result: COMPLIANT (with one noted EXTENSION: test fixtures)
  Checked By: Main agent (phase orchestrator)
  Notes / risks (not contradictions, flagged for Implementer):
    1. Gate 0.3 shells out to `shasum -a 256` — platform is Windows/Git Bash; if `shasum` is not executable from the test runner's shell, the Implementer may adapt the comparison method and must document the deviation in the status file.
    2. Gate 0.4 requires a live LLM call, but no API key env vars are set and the phase LLM budget is $0. Awaiting user decision on provider/key before that gate can pass.

[2026-07-17 00:47] Phase 0 Post-Implementation Check
  Changed: src/, tests/, test-pdfs/, templates/, prompts/, scripts/, package.json, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts, .gitignore, .state/phase-0-status.json (full list in git commit 6c0f4e5)
  Vision Docs Checked: `Project Vision/01_PRODUCT_VISION_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  Sections Checked: §3, §4.1/4.2/4.4, §5, §7 (same mapping as pre-implementation check)
  User Decisions Recorded:
    - LLM provider: Anthropic Messages API (key via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, git-ignored .env fallback)
    - Gate 0.4: one live smoke call allowed as de-minimis exception to the $0 phase budget
  Result: COMPLIANT (deviations are implementation adaptations, not vision conflicts: certutil fallback for Gate 0.3, Gate 0.8 test restructured for Ink 7, .env fallback in LLM client — all documented in .state/phase-0-status.json `deviations`)
  Checked By: Main agent (phase orchestrator); independent Verifier sub-agent check in progress
  Gate 0.4 Evidence: `LLM Call | Tokens: 17/4 | Cost: $0.0000` (~$0.00004 actual); full suite 10/10 green with key loaded

[2026-07-17 00:55] Phase 0 DOX Closeout
  Changed: Root `AGENTS.md` (Child DOX Index), new child contracts: `src/AGENTS.md`, `tests/AGENTS.md`, `test-pdfs/AGENTS.md`, `prompts/AGENTS.md`, `scripts/AGENTS.md`, `.state/AGENTS.md`
  Decision: `templates/` cannot hold a DOX contract at `templates/AGENTS.md` because that path is the wiki constitution template artifact required by `PHASE_00_infrastructure.md` §2.1; the folder's rules are recorded inline in the root Child DOX Index instead
  Docs intentionally left unchanged: `Implementation Plan/AGENTS.md` (its statement that implementation subfolders are indexed in the root AGENTS.md remains accurate); `Project Vision/AGENTS.md` (no vision content changed)
  Result: COMPLIANT — DOX hierarchy now matches the Phase 0 tree
  Checked By: Main agent (phase orchestrator)
